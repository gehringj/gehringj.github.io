### Experience
**Remote Sensing of Rivers**
- Developed maps of river water extent and models of water quantity in natural systems using satellite imagery and altimetry
- Compiled spectral data using Google Earth Engine to quantify water quality parameters
- Automated data collection and processing using R and Python code
- Published findings in scientific journals

**Data Synthesis of US Groundwater**
- Gathered and processed large datasets of groundwater measurements from government agencies for the nation
- Developed maps which fill gaps in data for groundwater isotope measurements using geospatial analysis
- Compiled important environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to predict concentrations using machine learning packages (Random Forest)
- Published novel findings in a scientific journal and created data visualization tools for increased accessibility
